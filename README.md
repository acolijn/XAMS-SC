# XAMS Slow Control

Monitoring and convenience control of the XAMS slow-control hardware: one NI
cDAQ-9174 chassis, two CAEN DT1470ET high-voltage supplies, a Lake Shore 335
and a UPS. Storage, plotting, alarming and a small web UI.

Every device service reads its instrument and publishes to a local MQTT
broker. Nothing writes to a database directly. Storage, alarming and the UI
are all subscribers, so any of them can be added or replaced without touching
a driver.

```

                             └─► web UI (FastAPI, 127.0.0.1:8000)
```

**The files are the truth; the database is an index over them.** If PostgreSQL
is lost, replay the archive into a new one. Nothing in any driver changes.

**Everything is read-only.** No setpoint can be written to any instrument.

## The manual

**All documentation lives in [`docs/`](docs/), and is served by the web UI
itself at <http://127.0.0.1:8000/manual>** — so it is on the lab PC whether or
not the building network is.

To read it as a site, with search and the generated channel and alarm tables:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[docs]"
python -m mkdocs serve -a 127.0.0.1:8001
```

Port 8001, not 8000 — 8000 is the web UI itself.
