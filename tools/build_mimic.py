"""Build the P&ID mimic SVG from the drawing. See DESIGN.md §8.2.

    python tools/build_mimic.py

Converts `notes/xams_piping_and_instrumentation.pdf` into
`src/xams_sc/api/static/xams_pid.svg`, and adds an empty `<text>` node beside
every instrument tag that corresponds to a channel. The web page fills those
in; the SVG itself is a static file.

**Re-run this when the P&ID is revised.** The drawing will eventually change,
and a mimic quietly out of date with the plant is a liability (§8.2). The tag
check below is what makes that visible rather than silent.

TAG NAMES. The drawing is the authoritative list (§3), and mostly the tags are
our channel names in lower case. The pressures are the exception: the P&ID
calls them **PT101–PT104** while `channels.yaml` calls them **p101–p104**,
following what the LabVIEW system logged. Both refer to the same transmitters.
The mapping is declared in TAG_ALIASES rather than inferred, so that the
divergence is stated rather than hidden inside a regular expression.
