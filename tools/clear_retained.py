"""Clear stale retained MQTT topics.

    python tools/clear_retained.py                 # report only
    python tools/clear_retained.py --apply         # actually clear them

WHY THIS IS NEEDED, AND WHY IT BITES.

Measurements and status are published retained (§3), so a newly started
subscriber immediately sees the current state instead of waiting a cycle. The
cost is that **a retained message outlives the process that published it, and
is re-delivered to every new subscriber**.

Two consequences, both seen on 17 September 2026:

  * A service that has been retired — `sim`, once the real drivers exist —
    keeps a heartbeat on the broker forever, and the staleness monitor will
    eventually alarm on something that was stopped deliberately.

  * Worse: every time the sinks reconnect, they re-ingest the retained value of
    every channel that was ever published, including channels no running
    service produces any more. Deleting those rows from the database does not
    help, because the next reconnect writes them again. The broker has to be
    cleared, or they come back.

A topic is deleted by publishing an empty payload to it with the retain flag
set. That is the only way; there is no "delete" in MQTT.

A retained measurement is treated as stale when any of these hold:

  * its payload says `"src":"sim"` — synthetic data must never persist as
    though it were a measurement;
  * no channel of that name exists in channels.yaml at all;
  * it is older than --max-age (default 1 hour). Nothing is publishing it, so
    whatever the status page or the mimic would show from it is not current.

Note that "enabled in channels.yaml" is NOT the test. The hv_*, ls_* and ups_*
channels are configured and legitimate but have no service until milestones 5
and 6, so a retained value for them is stale even though the channel is real.
