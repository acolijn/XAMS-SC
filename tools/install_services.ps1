.SYNOPSIS
    Install the XAMS slow-control services as Windows services, under NSSM.

.DESCRIPTION
    Run in an ELEVATED PowerShell from the repository root:

        .\tools\install_services.ps1              # start at boot (production)
        .\tools\install_services.ps1 -Manual      # restart on crash, not at boot
        .\tools\install_services.ps1 -Uninstall   # remove them again

    Idempotent: re-running updates the existing services in place.

    WHAT THIS CHANGES, AND WHY IT MATTERS (DESIGN.md §12).

    Until now the services were plain processes started by `xams-ctl`, which
    meant a reboot left the lab PC with a broker, a database and a Grafana —
    and nothing acquiring, storing or alarming. Nothing would have said so,
    because the thing that would say so was also down.

    §12 keeps auto-start off "while LabVIEW is the fallback", because every
    device admits one process and a service starting at boot would claim the
    hardware and lock LabVIEW out. That condition has passed: LabVIEW is
    closed, this system holds all four instruments, and real alarm thresholds
    depend on it.

    GOING BACK TO LABVIEW is therefore a deliberate action, and one command:

        xams-ctl stop --for-labview

    That stops the services AND suspends their auto-start, so a reboot does
    not quietly take the hardware back. `xams-ctl start` restores both.
