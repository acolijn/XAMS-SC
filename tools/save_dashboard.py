r"""Pull dashboards out of Grafana and into git. See DESIGN.md §12.

    .venv\Scripts\python.exe tools/save_dashboard.py --save    # Grafana -> git
    .venv\Scripts\python.exe tools/save_dashboard.py --check   # report drift only
    .venv\Scripts\python.exe tools/save_dashboard.py xams-overview   # just one

**Run it with the venv Python, not by double-clicking or `.\tools\...py`.**
Windows maps .py to the py launcher, which runs a different interpreter and
sends this script's errors to stderr where PowerShell's file-association path
discards them - so a failed run looks exactly like a successful one.

`--save` and `--check` need NO password: they only read, and they use the
read-only Grafana token in config/secrets.yaml. `--load` writes and still
requires `--password` or GRAFANA_PASSWORD.

**Run this after editing a dashboard in the Grafana UI.** Grafana keeps
dashboards in its own internal database; without them in git they are lost when
that database is lost or Grafana is reinstalled, taking hours of work with
them. That is the whole reason §12 asks for provisioning.

WHICH DIRECTION WINS, AND WHEN.

`allowUiUpdates: true` in the provisioning config means the UI can save, and
Grafana then treats its stored copy as newer than the file. Two consequences,
and the second one cost twenty minutes on 17 September 2026:

  * Grafana -> file: this tool, with `--save`. Run it after a UI edit, then
    commit `grafana/dashboards-archive/`.
  * file -> Grafana: `--load`. Editing the archived JSON by hand does NOT
    reach Grafana on its own.

Edit in ONE place. Both copies changed at once on 17 September 2026 - a panel
setting into the file, a layout in the UI - and `--load` would have reverted
the layout without a word.

`--check` reports whether the live dashboard and the file have diverged, which
is the question worth asking before a `git pull` or a reinstall.

# needs admin on this machine and could not be done. Fighting that cost an
# afternoon, so dashboards are no longer provisioned from a file at all.
#
# Instead: Grafana owns the live dashboard and the UI can edit it freely, and
# this directory is the ARCHIVE that git tracks. `--save` (the default) copies
# Grafana into it, `--load` puts it back into a fresh Grafana. The §12
# requirement is that
# a dashboard survives losing Grafana's database, and an archive plus a load
# command satisfies that just as well as provisioning did.
