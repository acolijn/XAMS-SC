# Alarm engine

Threshold evaluation, hysteresis, staleness, severity routing and the flight
recorder. Source: `src/xams_sc/alarms/`, [the design
specification](../DESIGN.md) §4.3 and §11. The thresholds currently in force
are in [the alarm reference](../reference/alarms.md).

The engine subscribes to `xams/meas/#`, evaluates every reading against
[`alarms.yaml`](config.md), publishes state to `xams/alarm/<channel>` and
notifies. **It decides; Grafana only displays.**

## Why Grafana's own alerting is not used

Grafana alerts by querying the database on a schedule, which puts PostgreSQL
*and* Grafana inside the alarm path: if either is down, slow, or mid-upgrade,
notifications do not go out — and the moment the database is struggling is
not the moment to lose alarms.

Alarms are the part of this system that must be most reliable, so the path is
kept as short as it can be:

```
measurement ──▶ bus ──▶ engine ──▶ SMS / email
```

No database, no web server, no scheduler. The alarm service runs **locally**
on the lab PC and never depends on the Nikhef VM — when the network is down
is exactly when somebody needs to see what is happening. Grafana still shows
alarm state and history, from the `alarm_events` table, because a *display*
of alarms may safely depend on a database that a *notification* may not.

## What raises an alarm

**Four thresholds per channel, EPICS-style**, each with its own severity and
its own notification routes:

| | |
|---|---|
| `lolo` | far below |
| `low` | below |
| `high` | above |
| `hihi` | far above |

Severity is one of `ok` · `minor` · `major` · `critical`, and it is per
threshold rather than per channel — `high` can be minor while `hihi` is
major.

Two further conditions raise alarms without any threshold being crossed:

- **Staleness.** A channel that has stopped arriving within
  `stale_after_seconds` (60 by default) is raised at the severity in the
  `staleness` block — `major`, the same as a threshold breach. A dead sensor
  must not read as healthy.
- **Bad quality.** A reading published with `quality=error` is a failed read,
  and is treated as a fault rather than ignored.

!!! warning "Physics thresholds are still largely TBD"
    `alarms.yaml` carries the structure, the staleness rules and the
    pressures; the rest await the LabVIEW `Error and Alarm` tab (§16). The
    engine logs a loud warning at startup when no physics thresholds are
    configured at all, so an empty file cannot pass for a quiet plant.

### Staleness needs a clock, not an event

This is why the engine cannot be purely event-driven: **the absence of a
message is the signal**, and nothing will deliver it. A background pass walks
every known channel and raises the ones that have gone quiet.

---

## Hysteresis: why it does not chatter

A channel already in alarm must come back past its threshold by `hysteresis`
of the limit's own magnitude — 2% by default — before it clears. Without
that, a value sitting exactly on a limit produces a stream of alternating
alarm and clear notifications, and the reader learns to ignore the channel.

A condition that persists is re-notified every `min_repeat_minutes`
(15 by default), not on every reading.

---

## Acknowledging is not fixing

Two ways to stop a repeating notification, and neither of them changes the
condition:

| | |
|---|---|
| **acknowledge** | stop repeating. The alarm stays active and stays visible |
| **silence** | suppress notifications for a set number of minutes — for a deliberate intervention |

**A new, worse condition clears an acknowledgement.** Acknowledging `high`
must not silence the `hihi` that follows it, so any transition to a higher
severity un-acknowledges the channel and notifies again.

The acknowledged flag is published with the alarm state, so the UI can show
"still in alarm, somebody has seen it" — which is a different thing from
"resolved", and the two must never look alike.

---

## What it publishes

```
xams/alarm/tt302   {"state":"minor","threshold":"high","value":-88.2,
                    "since":"2026-09-18T09:56:16.004Z","acknowledged":false}
```

Retained, so a UI connecting later sees the true current state rather than
waiting for the next transition. The [alarm sink](storage.md) stores
**transitions only** into `alarm_events` — a retained republish on every
reconnect would otherwise fill the table with rows saying the same thing.

It also publishes `xams/status/limits`, retained: the thresholds actually
loaded, per channel. The real risk is not a missing line on a plot, it is
believing a threshold is 2.0 when it is 20, and this makes what is in force
inspectable.

---

## Notification

A thin interface — `send_sms`, `send_email` — and the engine knows nothing
else, so what sits underneath is replaceable without touching alarm logic.
Routes come from the threshold's own `notify` list, falling back to email.

**SMS reuses the path the LabVIEW system already used**: the same MessageBird
library and sender id, because the numbers, the gateway and the message
format are all known to work and rebuilding that means rediscovering it.

!!! danger "The old script had its API key in plaintext"
    In three copies, on the Desktop. Here it is read from
    [`secrets.yaml`](config.md#secretsyaml) and must never enter the
    repository. That key has sat on a desktop for years and is a good
    candidate for rotation.

Every send is best effort and failures are logged rather than raised: a
gateway being down must not stop the engine evaluating the next reading. The
notifier reports how many deliveries succeeded per channel, so "nobody was
told" is distinguishable from "everybody was told". Phone numbers are masked
in the logs — logs get pasted into issues and emails.

The recipients list is read **at send time**, so a change made in the web UI
applies to the next alarm with no restart.

### The emails

`alarms/mail.py` renders both the alarm mail and the daily digest, and it is
written under constraints that look archaic until you have seen the result:
tables for layout, inline styles only, no images, no JavaScript, no web
fonts, and a plain-text alternative always. Outlook renders with Word's
engine, Gmail discards `<style>` blocks, and about half of all clients force
a light background — hence a light palette rather than the web UI's dark one.

**Colour is never the only signal.** A red border is decoration; the word
ALARM is information. Roughly one reader in twelve cannot reliably tell the
two colours apart.

**An alarm mail carries the plant around it** — the other channels, the
service states — because an alarm that says only "tt302 is high" makes the
reader open the web UI at three in the morning to find out whether anything
else is wrong.

The [daily report](../operating/email.md) runs from Task Scheduler as a
separate process, deliberately **not** inside the alarm service: a report is
a convenience and the alarm engine is not, and a scheduler bug that wedged a
thread would take the alarms down with it. Its state comes from retained
MQTT, so it can be sent while PostgreSQL is down — which is one of the things
worth being told about.

---

## Flight recorder

The last **ten minutes of every channel at full rate**, in memory, written
out the instant an alarm fires:

```
data/events/2026-09-17T13-02-11_pmain_hihi.jsonl
```

This is what the present system lacks. After an incident there are only
averaged values and no record of the approach to it — which is precisely the
part you want when working out what happened. The buffer is a fixed-length
deque costing a few megabytes, never written unless something goes wrong: the
guard against one failure must not create another.

It lives in the same process as the engine on purpose. The dump must happen
at the moment the alarm is raised, and routing that through the bus would add
a delay to the one moment where the data matters most.

---

## Reload

This is the service where `xams-ctl reload` matters most: a threshold change
is the commonest configuration edit, and restarting the engine to apply one
would lose every channel's alarm state — including which alarms are
acknowledged, which would start the notifications up again.

So the engine applies new thresholds in place, keeping state, and reports
that it did. A device service, which holds serial ports and DAQmx tasks built
from the channel map, answers the same reload by saying it needs a restart —
and that is how `xams-ctl reload` knows which services to name.
