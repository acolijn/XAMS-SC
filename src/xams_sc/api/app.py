"""Web UI. See DESIGN.md §8.1.

    python -m xams_sc.api

**Binds to 127.0.0.1, never 0.0.0.0.** `0.0.0.0` is the default in most
tutorials and in much example code; on this system it would expose the control
surface to the building network. Every bind address is explicit, and loopback
is the only accepted value without a recorded decision to the contrary (§8).

**Almost everything here is read-only.** Three things are not:

  * the flow-integrator reset, which changes a record rather than hardware
    (§7.5)
  * the Lake Shore setpoint, on output 1
  * the Lake Shore heater range, on output 1

The last two write to an instrument (§10). This module validates none of it
beyond "is that a number": the range, the connection, the read-back and the
audit record all belong to the service that owns the port, so a command from
this page is treated exactly like one from the CLI. Duplicating the limits
here would mean two numbers to keep in step, and the copy in channels.yaml is
the one that counts.

Deliberately plain: server-rendered HTML, a meta refresh, no JavaScript
framework and no build step. In three years a student must be able to change
it without installing a toolchain (§8.1).
