"""Live system state, from the bus. See DESIGN.md §8.1.

**Reads MQTT retained topics, never the database.** If PostgreSQL is down the
status page must still work — that is precisely when it is needed. A status
page that fails together with the component it reports on is worthless.

Retained topics make this cheap: on connect the broker replays the current
value of every channel, every heartbeat and every alarm, so the page is
correct within a second of starting rather than after a full log interval.
