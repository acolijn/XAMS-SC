"""Decoding the CAEN channel STATUS word. See DESIGN.md §7.2.

Separate from `devices/caen.py` because it is pure logic with no instrument
behind it, and because the web UI needs it. `caen.py` imports `serial`, which
belongs to the optional `hardware` extra — importing it into the UI would make
a machine that only serves pages need pyserial to start.

**Bit 0 is the answer to "is this channel on", not VMON.** The supplies have a
physical enable per channel, and a channel can be enabled while sitting at
zero volts:

    17 Sep 2026, hv_1 ch1 — STAT=1 (ON), VSET=0.0, VMON=0.0

Inferring on/off from the voltage, as the web UI first did, calls that "off".
It is not off: it is on, at zero, and one turn of a setpoint away from putting
volts on a photomultiplier. A display that understates what is live is the
kind of wrong that gets somebody hurt.

# The anode (hv_2 ch2) broke down twice on 23 September 2026 - 20 uA at
# +2500 V, then 5 uA at +2400 V. Both times the board cut the output within
# seconds and VMON decayed to zero over the next minute, while STAT stayed
# ON + UNDER_VOLTAGE (33). Bit 7 was never set and BDALARM stayed 0, so
# nothing keyed on them noticed: no clear was offered, and the channel sat
# "on" at its full setpoint with a dead output until somebody power-cycled
# the supply.
#
# So a trip is recognised from what the output DOES, as well as from the flag:
# energised, not ramping, UNDER_VOLTAGE set, and VMON below half the setpoint,
# for `COLLAPSE_CONFIRM_READS` reads in a row. A normal ramp carries RAMP_UP,
# so it cannot match; a channel current-limiting just below its setpoint
# stays above half of it until the board gives up and cuts it.

    front-panel switch - which is bit 10, and a different question:

      * `is_disabled(word)`  - the switch is OFF (bit 10)
      * `is_energised(word)` - the output is ON (bit 0)
      * neither              - switch on, output off. Permitted and inert.

    displayed a live channel as off, refused a setpoint to a channel that was
    ready for one, and warned that an enabled channel was dangerous to enable.
