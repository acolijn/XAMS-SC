    """Watches the two places data can be lost, and says so out loud.

    Principle 4 is "fail loudly, never silently", and this is the one place
    the principle is about the system's OWN data rather than an instrument's.
    Until now it was the place that obeyed it least: `PgWriter` counted every
    row it discarded at `max_pending`, and the only consumer logged the count
    at DEBUG. The default level is INFO, so the system's stated worst case —
    measurements thrown away — was invisible in normal operation.

    Two counters matter, and both are cumulative:

        pg.stats["dropped"]   rows discarded because the backlog was full
        bus.dropped           publishes lost because the outage buffer was

    A rise in either is real, unrecoverable loss: the row is not in the
    database and never will be. It is reported at ERROR, and the service
    publishes `degraded` so the loss is visible on /status and not only to
    somebody reading the log at the time.

    Reported on CHANGE, not on every cycle. A service that logs the same
    error every five seconds for a week teaches people to filter it out,
    which costs the next one. A reminder is repeated every `remind_after_s`
    so a long outage does not scroll away entirely.

    A backlog that is merely large is a warning, not a loss: the rows are
    still in memory and will be written when the database returns.
