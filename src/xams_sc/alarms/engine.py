"""Alarm evaluation. See DESIGN.md §11.

Subscribes to `xams/meas/#`, evaluates against `alarms.yaml`, and publishes
alarm state to `xams/alarm/<channel>`. It decides and notifies; Grafana only
displays the result.

**Grafana's own alerting is deliberately not used.** It works by querying the
database on a schedule, which puts PostgreSQL and Grafana inside the alarm
path: if either is down or slow, notifications do not go out. Alarms are the
part of this system that must be most reliable, so the path is kept as short as
possible — measurement, bus, engine, SMS — with no database and no web server
involved.

Four threshold levels per channel, EPICS-style: `lolo`, `low`, `high`, `hihi`.

**Staleness is an alarm at the same severity as a threshold breach.** A dead
sensor must not read as healthy, and a channel that has stopped arriving is
indistinguishable from one that never had a problem unless something says so.
