"""Alarm service: python -m xams_sc.alarms

Runs the alarm engine, the notifier and the flight recorder in one process.
They belong together — the recorder must dump at the instant the engine raises
an alarm, and routing that through the bus would add a delay to the one moment
where the data matters most.

Runs LOCALLY and never depends on the Nikhef VM (§12). When the network is down
is exactly when the operator needs to see what is happening.
