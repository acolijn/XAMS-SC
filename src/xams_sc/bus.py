"""MQTT publish/subscribe. See DESIGN.md §2.1, §3, §6.4.

Every service publishes here; nothing writes to a database directly. The bus
is what keeps acquisition, scaling, storage and alarming from entangling —
it makes the wrong thing awkward to do.

Topics (§3):

    xams/meas/<channel>             measurement, JSON, retained
    xams/status/<service>/heartbeat ISO-8601 UTC, retained
    xams/status/<service>/state     starting | running | degraded | stopped
    xams/alarm/<channel>            alarm state changes
    xams/cmd/<device>/<action>      control requests
    xams/ack/<device>/<action>      command acknowledgements

The broker is a shared dependency, so an outage must cost a visible gap and
never a silent one. This client buffers while disconnected and republishes in
order when the broker returns; if the buffer overflows, the loss is counted
and reported rather than passing unnoticed.
