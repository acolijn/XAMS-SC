"""CAEN DT1470ET high-voltage supplies. See DESIGN.md §7.2.

Two units, both on USB, ASCII protocol over the virtual COM port. No vendor
library.

**This driver writes exactly four things: `VSET`, `ON`, `OFF` and `BDCLR`**
(§10a). Everything else is read. `BDCLR` clears a latched trip, and only after
the tripped channels' setpoints are zeroed - see `_handle_clear`. A trip the
driver detects itself is answered with `VSET` 0 and `OFF` at once, with nobody
behind the command - see `_watch_trips`. There is
deliberately no code here that can change `MAXV`, `RUP`, `RDW`, `TRIP` or
`ISET` - protection stays configured on the instrument (§10 rule 2).

**`ON` is not the enable switch, and the difference matters.** Three separate
things decide whether there are volts on an electrode:

  * the **enable switch** on the front panel clears the `DISABLED` bit. It is
    a hand operation and no command here can change it.
  * **`ON`/`OFF`** energises a channel that is already enabled. That is the
    "turn on the HV" step, and it is this driver's business.
  * **`VSET`** decides where it ramps to.

Clearing `DISABLED` alone does nothing visible, which is exactly what was
observed on 18 September 2026 when the `nai` enable was flipped and the
channel sat at `STAT=0`: permitted, but not energised.

A write is validated against `channels.yaml`, refused outright if it would put
a non-zero setpoint on a channel that is not enabled (§10a), **read back from
the board before it is called successful**, acknowledged on the bus and
recorded in the audit trail.

The same invariant is also ENFORCED, once per read cycle: a channel whose
enable switch is off and whose `VSET` is not zero has it written to zero. That
state is not reachable through this driver - it arrives when somebody flips a
switch on a channel that was de-energised with its setpoint still loaded - and
until it is cleared, the next flip of that switch is an unannounced ramp. See
`_enforce_disabled_zero`.

Both units answer at **board address 0**: they are two independent USB
connections, not a daisy chain. They are told apart by which port their
`BDSNUM` came back on, never by address and never by COM number (§6.2).

SIGN CONVENTION. The supplies report `VMON` and `VSET` as **unsigned
magnitudes**, with polarity as a separate `POL` parameter. A cathode at minus
2250 volts answers "2250.0". The sign is applied here, once, and values are
stored signed (§7.2). This is almost certainly what the LabVIEW
`DAISY_polarity_signs.vi` exists to do.
