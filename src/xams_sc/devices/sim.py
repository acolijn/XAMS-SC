"""Simulated device service. See DESIGN.md §13.

Milestone 1 is the whole stack running with no instruments attached: bus,
writers, alarms and UI, on a laptop. This is the service that makes that
possible, and it is also how the stack is developed without occupying the
lab PC — which is still running LabVIEW.

The synthetic values are plausible, not physical. They exist so that a plot
has something on it and a writer has something to store. Nobody should read
physics out of them, so every simulated channel is deliberately given a
visible wobble rather than a flat line.
