"""NI cDAQ-9174 service. See DESIGN.md §7.1.

Read-only. The chassis has no output module, so this service has no control
path and never writes anything to hardware.

All four modules are low-rate delta-sigma with differing aggregate rates and
cannot share one hardware-timed task. Slow control reads at 1 Hz, so this uses
**on-demand (software-timed) reads**, one task per module, polled in sequence.
The CompactDAQ timing-engine constraint then does not apply.

Tasks actually created:

    9207     ai0:7 voltage   and ai8:9 current (4-20 mA strain gauges)
    9226     ai0:6 PT1000    (ai7 not connected)
    9216_1   ai0:6 PT100     (ai7 not connected)
    9216_2   none — module entirely unconnected, no task created

Modules are addressed by **alias** (`9207/ai0`), not `cDAQ1Mod1/ai0`. Aliases
are configured in NI-MAX and survive re-slotting.

# Excitation current, per module model. MEASURED FROM THE HARDWARE, 17 Sep 2026.
#
# Each module accepts EXACTLY ONE value, and neither is the DAQmx default of
# 2.5 mA — so both must be set explicitly or the task fails to configure:
#
#     NI 9226 (PT1000): 100 uA only. 1 mA and 2.5 mA are both refused.
#     NI 9216 (PT100):  1 mA only.   100 uA and 2.5 mA are both refused.
#
# The physics agrees: 1000 ohm at 1 mA would dissipate a milliwatt in the
# sensor and self-heat it, which is why the PT1000 module runs at a tenth of
# the current. Do not "simplify" this by dropping the argument and letting
# DAQmx choose — §7.1's example code does exactly that, and it does not work.
