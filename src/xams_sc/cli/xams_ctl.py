"""xams-ctl — start, stop, check and reload the services. See DESIGN.md §12.

One command, correct order, every time.

    xams-ctl start | stop | restart | status | reload | check

`stop` releases all hardware for LabVIEW, which matters while LabVIEW is still
the fallback: every device admits only one process.

Milestone 1 runs the services as plain processes. From the trial phase they
run under NSSM as Windows services (§12), and this command drives those
instead — which is why the verbs are chosen to match.
