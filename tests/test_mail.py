"""The alarm and digest emails. See DESIGN.md §11.

These are not tests of how the mail looks. They pin down the handful of things
that would make it actively misleading, because an email is read hours after
it was written, by somebody who cannot check it against the instrument.

The rules that matter:

  * a stale reading shows a dash, never its last number
  * colour is never the only signal
  * an alarm mail carries the plant around it, not just the channel
  * nothing renders as a broken template when data is missing
