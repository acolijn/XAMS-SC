"""Shared fixtures. See DESIGN.md §2.1, and `doubles.py` for the stand-ins.

Every test file used to carry its own `FakeBus`, its own `StubDrift` and its
own `config_dir` — ten, four and four copies respectively. That is not merely
repetition. The copies drifted: one recorded parsed payloads and the rest
recorded strings, one keyed handlers by topic where the real bus keeps a list,
and when `recipients.yaml` left the repository three of the four `config_dir`
copies were updated and the fourth was not, which broke the suite on a fresh
clone.

So there is one of each here. A test that needs different behaviour should
still define its own — shadowing a fixture is normal — but it should be
because the test needs it, not because it was written before this file.
