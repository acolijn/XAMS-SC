"""How /hv reports a channel's state. See DESIGN.md §7.2, §8.1.

The decoding itself is covered in `test_hv_status.py`; what is pinned here is
what a person actually reads on the page, because that is where two mistakes
in a row were made.

**First:** the page inferred on/off from `VMON > 1`, so a channel energised at
zero volts read as "off".

**Second:** the fix used STAT bit 0 as "enabled" — but bit 0 is the OUTPUT.
The front-panel enable switch is bit 10. A channel whose switch had been
flipped on but which was not energised matched nothing and fell through to
"off" again, telling the operator their switch had not worked.

Four states, and the middle two are the ones worth care:

    disabled   bit 10          the front-panel switch is off
    enabled    neither bit     switch on, output NOT energised
    ON 0 V     bit 0, VMON~0   energised, sitting at zero volts
    ON         bit 0, VMON!=0  energised with volts out
