"""Which channels a service is responsible for. See DESIGN.md §6.1, §7.2.

**A failed read marked nothing at all for the CAEN service, and nothing
noticed.** `_publish_error` asked `channels_for(self.name)`, which matches on
the channel's DEVICE. For most services the device id and the service name
are the same word, so it worked by coincidence: `cdaq` reads channels whose
device is `cdaq`. The CAEN service is called `caen` and its channels belong
to `hv_1` and `hv_2`, so the list came back empty.

What that cost: both supplies unreachable, `read()` raises, the ERROR
measurements it had built are discarded with the exception, and
`_publish_error` then marks none of the 32 channels. Nothing is published at
all. The retained topics keep the last good voltages, the channels stay
`healthy` because that is quality-and-age and the age has not run out yet,
and the badge at the top of every page goes on saying ALL OK for a minute
while the high voltage is not being read. That is the frozen plausible value
principle 4 exists to forbid, on the one readout where it matters most.

The old test for this asserted only that `read()` raises. What is published
afterwards - the part an operator actually sees - was never checked.

The first two tests here are the structural guard. They would have caught
this on the day it was written, and they catch the next service whose device
id stops matching its name.
