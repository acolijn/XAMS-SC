"""Saying so when data is thrown away. See DESIGN.md §2.1, principle 4.

"Fail loudly, never silently" is the principle that shows up most often in
this code, and this is the one place it is about the system's OWN data rather
than an instrument's reading. It was also the place that obeyed it least:
`PgWriter` counted every row it discarded when the backlog hit `max_pending`,
and the only thing that read the counter logged it at DEBUG. The default
level is INFO, so the system's stated worst case — measurements thrown away —
was invisible in normal running.

`Bus.dropped` was worse than invisible: `_flush` zeroed it, so by the time
anything asked, the answer was almost always 0.

What is pinned here is the difference between loss and delay. A full backlog
is a delay — the rows are in memory and will be written when the database
returns — and rates a warning. A discarded row is loss, is unrecoverable, and
must be an ERROR and a `degraded` service state, so it is visible on /status
to somebody who was not reading the log at the time.

Reported on change, not on every cycle: a service that logs the same error
every five seconds for a week teaches people to filter it out, which costs
the next one.
