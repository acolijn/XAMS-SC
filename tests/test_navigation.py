"""Which page answers which question. See DESIGN.md §8.1, §8.2.

The site used to open on an Overview that answered two questions at once —
"is everything all right?" and "change something" — because the Lake Shore
and the flow reset had nowhere else to be. They are separate questions, asked
at different moments, and they are now separate pages:

    /         the plant, drawn, live, READ-ONLY
    /hv       Control: everything that writes to an instrument
    /system   System health: is the software all right
    /status   the channel list
    /alarms   the alarm chain
    /logs     the service logs

What is pinned here is that every one of them answers, that the old
bookmarks still work, and that no page grew a second job.
