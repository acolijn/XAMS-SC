"""The Alarms page and the recipient list. See DESIGN.md §4.4, §8.1, §11.

The alarm chain is the least visible part of this system and the most
consequential, and this page is where it becomes visible: what has fired, what
*would* fire, and who is told.

Two things here are worth more than the rest:

**Nobody on the alarm list is a WARNING, not a refusal.** Turning everyone off
may be exactly what somebody means during an intervention. It is said loudly
and allowed.

**Alarms and the daily report are two lists.** A tick in one is not a tick in
the other, and a file written before the split - `enabled:` alone - is read as
both, because that is what it meant when it was written.

**A recipient with neither an email nor a phone is WARNED ABOUT, not refused.**
They would sit on the list looking notified and hear nothing, which is the
silent failure this whole subsystem exists to avoid - so it is said, loudly and
by name. It is not a reason to refuse the save: a blank field is somebody
mid-edit far more often than it is a mistake, and one of them must not hold the
rest of the list hostage.
