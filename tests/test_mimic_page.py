"""The P&ID page's column and its liveness. See DESIGN.md §8.2.

Two things are pinned here, and the second is the one that matters.

**Order.** The alarm card grows and shrinks as alarms come and go. Anything
below it therefore moves, so it sits at the BOTTOM and the cards whose height
never changes sit above it. What replaces it at the top is a fixed-height line
that says only whether something is wrong — glance at that, read the card
afterwards.

**Liveness.** Every channel that stops reading already goes to a dash rather
than its last good number. The case that was NOT handled is the page itself
going quiet: `refresh` caught its own fetch failure and returned, keeping what
was drawn, so a dead web UI or a dropped network left a screen full of frozen
plausible values looking live. On the one page that is left open on a display
all day, that is the exact failure principle 4 names.
