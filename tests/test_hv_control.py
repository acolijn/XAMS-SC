"""The CAEN setpoint write path. See DESIGN.md §10a.

**This is the code that puts kilovolts on electrodes.** The tests are
overwhelmingly about refusal, because the failure modes are not symmetric: a
command wrongly refused is an annoyance, and a command wrongly accepted is
4.2 kV on an anode nobody was standing next to.

The invariant the whole design rests on:

> A channel that is not enabled has `VSET` = 0.

The enable is a hand operation and the board ramps to `VSET` the instant it is
flipped. If the invariant holds, flipping the switch is always safe. If it does
not, flipping it is a step into an unannounced voltage.

# de-energised - which ramps down and leaves VSET alone - and then disabled by
# hand, by somebody with every reason to believe it is off, because it is. The
# board is now holding a disabled channel with kilovolts in its setpoint, and
# the next flip of that switch ramps straight to them.
