"""Every `onsubmit` confirmation must actually be a confirmation. See §10a.

**Three of the four confirm dialogs on this site did nothing, and one of them
guarded the high voltage.** They looked right in the template and they were
never rendered by a test, so nothing noticed.

Two separate ways of breaking them, both silent:

  * a **raw newline inside a JS string literal**. Written into the template
    as real blank lines to keep the message readable, which is a syntax error
    in JavaScript. The handler throws, no dialog appears, and - because an
    exception in an inline handler does not cancel anything - the form
    submits regardless.

  * **`tojson` inside a double-quoted attribute**. It writes a double-quoted
    JS string, so the first quote it emits ends `onsubmit="` and the rest of
    the message becomes stray markup.

Neither shows up in a page that merely renders, which is why this file asserts
on the rendered HTML rather than on the templates.
