"""Cross-site requests to the web UI. See DESIGN.md §8, §8.1, §10.

The UI binds to 127.0.0.1 and has no login, and until this check existed the
loopback bind was doing all the work. It cannot: it keeps the BUILDING
network out, not the browser already running on the lab PC. Any page an
operator opens there can submit a hidden form to 127.0.0.1:8000, and a plain
form POST takes no CORS preflight - the browser sends it, the command runs,
and the `by` field carries whatever name the attacker chose into the audit
trail.

What these tests hold down:

  * the writes that reach an instrument (`/hv/output`, `/hv/apply`, the Lake
    Shore pair) cannot be driven from another site
  * neither can `/alarms/notify`, which is the one control that can make a
    sick plant look quiet
  * a `Host` this server does not answer to is refused outright, which is
    what stops DNS rebinding from reading /api/state and the recipient list
  * the pages themselves still work, GET and POST, from the UI's own origin

The last one matters as much as the rest. A check that refuses everything
passes the first four and leaves nobody able to turn the heater off.
